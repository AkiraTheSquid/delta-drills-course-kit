"""bkt_mastery.py — per-atom Bayesian Knowledge Tracing with encompassing FIRe.

THE mastery + prioritization signal for Delta Drills. It replaces per-subtopic
EWMA *as the algorithm driver*; the EWMA machinery in adaptive.py, if kept at
all, is now only a learner-facing "area score" readout (and that readout is
better derived from `area_scores()` below — single source of truth).

Model
-----
Each atom (concept-graph node) carries a BKT posterior  L = P(skill known):

  * observe()  — Bayesian evidence update from a graded attempt (guess/slip),
                 followed by the learn-transit step (Corbett & Anderson 1994).
  * FIRe       — practicing (and clearing) an ADVANCED atom credits the SIMPLER
                 atoms it encompasses — Math Academy's Fractional Implicit
                 Repetitions. A single-hop implicit-transit of magnitude
                 pT * propagation_weight along each encompassing edge of the v3
                 graph. **Encompassing edges are the ONLY channel by which
                 evidence is shared between atoms** — vanilla BKT treats every
                 skill independently, so this is the necessary completion, not a
                 redundancy.
  * forgetting — NOT here. L is what the evidence says was LEARNED; whether
                 it is still retrievable is `memory_model`'s FSRS recall R for
                 the concept, applied at read time by callers that have the
                 learner (`current_mastery(..., recall=R)`,
                 `kc_graph.kc_mastery`). Until 2026-09-24 this module ran its
                 own 14-day half-life toward p_init, both at read time and
                 BEFORE every update, so each update baked the decay into the
                 stored L. Seth's prod state that day: `torch.elementwise-ops`
                 read 0.55 here while FSRS put its recall at 0.98 (S = 67 d).

Calibration: every numeric constant here is a v0 default, NOT literature-derived
(mirrors the learner_sim.py model validated 2026-05-28). Re-fit once real
per-atom attempt data accumulates. See papers/MASTERY_ESTIMATION_REFERENCE_v2.md.

    still moves toward knowing it; what it is not is a demonstration that they

    🔴 The transit is also why this knob is SMALL. `p_transit` fires on every

    an atom up toward the unlock bar — more slowly, not never. Gating the

    even when you fail" — which is perverse for difficulty targeting: from a
