## Concept

A name holds one value — but that value can itself be a **container** holding
many.

A **list** is written with square brackets, and holds its items in order:

```python
scores = [10, 20, 30]
print(scores)
print(len(scores))
# Hidden checks
assert _delta_output == '[10, 20, 30]\n3\n'
```

`len(...)` asks the container how many items it holds. Asking is better than
remembering: the answer stays right when the list changes.

A list can hold values of different types, and its items can themselves be
lists. A list of lists is how a table (rows of equal length) is written before
any library gets involved:

```python
mixed = [1, "two", 3.0]
rows = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

print(mixed)
print(rows)
print(len(rows), "rows of", len(rows[0]))
# Hidden checks
assert _delta_output == "[1, 'two', 3.0]\n[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\n2 rows of 3\n"
```

A **tuple** is written with parentheses instead. It holds items in order in
exactly the same way — the difference is that a tuple cannot be changed after it
is built:

```python
point = (3, 4)
print(point, len(point))
# Hidden checks
assert _delta_output == '(3, 4) 2\n'
```

That is why a tuple is the usual way to hand back several answers at once: it is
a fixed group of values, not a collection you are still working on. Use a list
when the contents will grow or change, a tuple when they are one finished
answer.

The two convert into each other, and converting always produces a NEW container:

```python
values = [1, 2, 3]
as_tuple = tuple(values)
back = list(as_tuple)

print(as_tuple)
print(back)
print("same length:", len(values) == len(back))
# Hidden checks
assert _delta_output == '(1, 2, 3)\n[1, 2, 3]\nsame length: True\n'
```

A one-item tuple needs a trailing comma — `(5)` is just the number 5 with
brackets around it, while `(5,)` is a tuple holding it:

```python
print(type((5)).__name__)
print(type((5,)).__name__)
# Hidden checks
assert _delta_output == 'int\ntuple\n'
```

## Watch out

- **Brackets decide the type** — `[a, b]` is a list, `(a, b)` is a tuple. They
  hold the same values and are still different types.
- **`len` counts the OUTER level only** — `len([[1, 2, 3]])` is `1`: one inner
  list. What is inside it is a second question.
- **`(5)` is not a tuple** — a one-item tuple is `(5,)`.

## Worked example

A table as a list of lists, measured at both levels, then frozen into a tuple.

```python
rows = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

n_rows = len(rows)
n_cols = len(rows[0])

print("rows:", n_rows)
print("columns:", n_cols)

shape = (n_rows, n_cols)
print("as one finished answer:", shape,
      type(shape).__name__)
# Hidden checks
assert _delta_output == 'rows: 2\ncolumns: 3\nas one finished answer: (2, 3) tuple\n'
```

Why each step:

1. `len(rows)` counts the inner lists — the rows of the table.
2. `len(rows[0])` reaches into the first row and counts what IT holds. Two
   levels, two separate measurements.
3. The pair is packed into a tuple because it is one finished answer with two
   parts, which is exactly the job a tuple is for.

## Faded practice

### q580
Build the list, then ask it how long it is.

```python starter
def solve(a, b, c):
    """Build the list, then measure it."""
    items = [a, b, c]
    return (items, _____(items))
```

```python solution
def solve(a, b, c):
    """Build the list, then measure it."""
    items = [a, b, c]
    return (items, len(items))
```

### q581
Two values in a tuple — parentheses, not brackets.

```python starter
def solve(a, b):
    """A tuple of the two values."""
    return _____a, b_____
```

```python solution
def solve(a, b):
    """A tuple of the two values."""
    return (a, b)
```

### q744
The trailing comma is what makes the tuple.

```python starter
def solve(x):
    """(x) is just x; (x,) is a tuple holding it."""
    return (type((x)).__name__, type(_____).__name__)
```

```python solution
def solve(x):
    """(x) is just x; (x,) is a tuple holding it."""
    return (type((x)).__name__, type((x,)).__name__)
```

### q745
A table is a list whose items are lists.

```python starter
def solve(a, b, c, d):
    """A table is a list whose items are lists."""
    table = [_____, _____]
    return (table, len(table))
```

```python solution
def solve(a, b, c, d):
    """A table is a list whose items are lists."""
    table = [[a, b], [c, d]]
    return (table, len(table))
```

### q746
Wrap the whole list as one item, then measure both containers.

```python starter
def solve(items):
    """A list holding one thing — which happens to be a list."""
    outer = _____
    return (len(items), len(outer))
```

```python solution
def solve(items):
    """A list holding one thing — which happens to be a list."""
    outer = [items]
    return (len(items), len(outer))
```

### q747
Rehouse the items in a tuple; the count comes along unchanged.

```python starter
def solve(values):
    """tuple() rehouses the items; the count comes along unchanged."""
    t = _____(values)
    return (t, len(t))
```

```python solution
def solve(values):
    """tuple() rehouses the items; the count comes along unchanged."""
    t = tuple(values)
    return (t, len(t))
```

### q748
Thaw a tuple into a list, and prove it with the type name.

```python starter
def solve(pair):
    """list() thaws a tuple into a list you could change."""
    lst = _____(pair)
    return (lst, type(lst).__name__)
```

```python solution
def solve(pair):
    """list() thaws a tuple into a list you could change."""
    lst = list(pair)
    return (lst, type(lst).__name__)
```

### q749
Same size is a question for len, answered twice.

```python starter
def solve(a, b):
    """Same size is a question for len, answered twice."""
    return _____(a) == _____(b)
```

```python solution
def solve(a, b):
    """Same size is a question for len, answered twice."""
    return len(a) == len(b)
```

### q750
Same values, different brackets, different type.

```python starter
def solve(a, b):
    """Same values, different brackets, different type."""
    return (type(_____).__name__, type(_____).__name__)
```

```python solution
def solve(a, b):
    """Same values, different brackets, different type."""
    return (type([a, b]).__name__, type((a, b)).__name__)
```

### q751
Build as a list, hand back as a tuple.

```python starter
def solve(a, b, c):
    """Build as a list, hand back as a tuple."""
    built = [a, b, c]
    frozen = _____(built)
    return (frozen, len(frozen))
```

```python solution
def solve(a, b, c):
    """Build as a list, hand back as a tuple."""
    built = [a, b, c]
    frozen = tuple(built)
    return (frozen, len(frozen))
```

## Solo practice

### q582
A list of inner lists, measured at both levels.

The two measurements are different questions asked at different depths, and
mixing them up is the most common early mistake with nested data:

```python worked
rows = [["a", "b", "c"], ["d", "e", "f"]]

print("how many rows:", len(rows))
print("how wide is a row:", len(rows[0]))
print("the first row itself:", rows[0])
# Hidden checks
assert _delta_output == "how many rows: 2\nhow wide is a row: 3\nthe first row itself: ['a', 'b', 'c']\n"
```

### q583
A round trip: list to tuple and back, with the lengths compared.

### q752
Two levels, two measurements, one finished answer — and its kind.

### q753
Convert the tuple first; then equality compares item by item.

### q754
Rows of different lengths are still one item each.

### q755
One comma is the whole difference between a tuple and a bare value.

### q756
Three containers, one count: conversions never change how many.

### q757
A container does not convert its contents — each item keeps its kind.

### q758
An empty list is a no; a list HOLDING it is not empty.

### q759
Equal contents still need equal containers.

## Integrated practice

### q584
The same three values in both containers, reported with their sizes.

### q585
Count the rows, measure every one of them, and say whether they agree.

### q760
Two rows, one measured pair — and whether the rows agree on length.

### q761
A report: the data, its total, its count — frozen together, with its kind named.

## Misconceptions

- **"A tuple is just a list that is written differently."** — It is a different
  type, and it cannot be changed once built. A grader comparing a list against a
  tuple reports them as unequal.
- **"`len` gives the total number of values."** — It gives the number of items at
  the top level. For a list of lists that is the number of rows.
- **"Converting a list to a tuple changes the list."** — It builds a new
  container. The original list is still there, unchanged.
