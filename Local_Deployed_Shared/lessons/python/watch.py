"""watch.py — health checks for lessons/python (the py-0 prerequisite floor).

py-0 is the seven concepts that sit BELOW torch.tensor-model: values and
names, types, lists and tuples, indexing, calling functions, defining
functions, and dots/imports. It exists so the first thing a learner reads has
something prior to it — before 2026-08-28 the course had exactly one root,
torch.tensor-model, and every piece of jargon on that page pointed FORWARD
into lessons the learner had not reached.

Every way this floor breaks is quiet, which is what the checks below are for:

  - a page here reaching for torch/numpy/einops teaches above its own level,
    and nothing else in the pipeline would notice;
  - the floor drifting out from under np-1 (torch.tensor-model losing its
    python prereqs) puts the root back where it was, silently;
  - 🔴 wiring a python ATOM as a prerequisite of tensor-wraps-ndarray locks
    every existing account out of the whole numpy course. atom_engine's
    item_is_unlocked needs EVERY gating prerequisite atom ready, `is_hard_gate`
    is not read at runtime, and no learner has python evidence yet. This was
    tried, measured, and reverted the same hour; the check is the memory of it.

Runs via `mod watch` — exit 0 = PASS, exit non-zero = FAIL.

# ── The three standing content guards ─────────
# Filled 2026-08-29 on Seth's instruction. This folder is where the guards bite
# hardest: py-0 is the FLOOR, so a drill here reaching for an untaught
# construct has nothing earlier to be taught by. The three open cases recorded
# in README.md (q578 membership, q585 generator expression + set, q603 an `if`)
# are exactly this rule, found by hand before it was mechanised.
# ARENA grounding is scoped to `python.` too, and is expected to be silent
# here: the floor teaches no library at all, and a python page that starts
# declaring torch symbols has stopped being the floor.
