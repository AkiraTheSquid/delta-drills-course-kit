"""watch.py — health checks for notebooks

Runs via `mod watch` — exit 0 = PASS, exit non-zero = FAIL.

This folder holds BUILD OUTPUT, not source, from TWO compilers with two
different guarantees.

`<lesson-id>.json` + `manifest.json` — the Delta Drills lessons.
`scripts/compile_web_notebooks.py` compiles each lesson with the very same
`build_notebook` that writes the Colab `.ipynb` files, so the web notebook and
the Colab notebook cannot describe different lessons. That guarantee is only
worth something while the two are actually in step — a `.ipynb` regenerated
without re-running the web compiler would leave this folder describing last
week's lesson, and nothing on the page would look wrong. So the main check for
that set is a cell-for-cell comparison against the published notebooks.

`arena-<slug>.json` + `arena-index.json` — the ARENA curriculum, since
2026-09-01. `scripts/compile_arena_notebooks.py` rewrites Callum McDougall's
upstream `.ipynb` into the same cell shape so the Courses tab can open a
section IN the app instead of at Google Colab. There is no shared-compiler
guarantee for these, because the source is not ours — the invariant that
replaces it is that the set of notebooks equals the set of sections the Courses
tab links to. A section with no notebook is a row that opens an error.

🔴 THE TWO SETS SHARE A FOLDER AND EACH COMPILER SWEEPS ONLY ITS OWN PREFIX.
Both delete files their own index does not name; a sweep over a bare `*.json`
glob would delete the other compiler's whole output.
