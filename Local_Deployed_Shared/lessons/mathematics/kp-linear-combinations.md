## Concept

A linear combination $a\mathbf u+b\mathbf v$ scales vectors, then adds them. The span of $\mathbf u,\mathbf v$ is the set of all such combinations with real weights. Weights may be negative; span is not restricted to the region between the vectors.

Vectors are linearly independent if no nonzero choice of weights gives the zero vector. Equivalently, a target in their span has unique coordinates in those vectors. Dependent vectors provide redundant directions. For example, $(1,2)$ and $(2,4)$ span only a line; two independent vectors in $\mathbb R^2$ span the whole plane and form a basis.

A basis is an independent spanning set. Standard components are coordinates in the standard basis; changing the basis changes the weights, not the target vector. Two independent vectors in $\mathbb R^3$ span a plane through zero, not all of 3D space.

For geometry based at a point $A$, use
$$P=A+uE_1+vE_2.$$
The vector $P-A$ is in the span of the edge directions. Adding $A$ translates that plane. Triangle bounds on the weights come later; span alone imposes no bounds.

**Triangles: nondegenerate means independent edges.** Take a triangle with corners $A$, $B$, $C$ and treat its two edges from $A$ as vectors, $B-A$ and $C-A$. The triangle is nondegenerate, meaning its area is greater than zero, exactly when those two edges are linearly independent: neither is a multiple of the other. If $C-A=k(B-A)$ for some number $k$, then $C$ sits on the line through $A$ and $B$. The triangle is squashed flat, its area is zero, and it is called degenerate.

For 2D edges $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$, one number separates the two cases: the 2D cross product $ad-bc$. Its size is the area of the parallelogram the two edges make, so the triangle's area is half of it. It is zero exactly when the edges are dependent. For example, $(3,1)$ and $(1,2)$ give $3\cdot2-1\cdot1=5$, a triangle of area $2.5$; $(3,1)$ and $(6,2)$ give $3\cdot2-1\cdot6=0$, a flat one.

```figure independence
Interactive figure (in the app): drag corner C, or turn the angle between the two edges, and watch the cross product and the triangle's area. Both drop to zero when C lands on the line through A and B.
```

## Worked example

Express $P=(5,3)$ in the basis $E_1=(2,0)$, $E_2=(1,3)$.

**On paper.** Look for weights $u,v$ with $uE_1+vE_2=P$, and read off one equation per row:
$$u\begin{pmatrix}2\\0\end{pmatrix}+v\begin{pmatrix}1\\3\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}5\\3\end{pmatrix}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad\begin{aligned}2u+v&=5\\3v&=3\end{aligned}$$
The second equation gives $v=1$. Substituting, $2u+1=5$, so $u=2$. Check:
$$2\begin{pmatrix}2\\0\end{pmatrix}+1\begin{pmatrix}1\\3\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}4+1\\0+3\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}5\\3\end{pmatrix}.$$
The standard coordinates $(5,3)$ and the basis coordinates $(2,1)$ describe the same vector in different bases.

In contrast, no combination of $(1,2)$ and $(2,4)$ gives $(0,1)$, because the second vector is twice the first:
$$a\begin{pmatrix}1\\2\end{pmatrix}+b\begin{pmatrix}2\\4\end{pmatrix}=(a+2b)\begin{pmatrix}1\\2\end{pmatrix}.$$
Every reachable vector has second component twice its first.

**In code.** Rebuild the target from its weights, then recover the weights by solving the system whose columns are the basis vectors.

```python
import torch as t

e1 = t.tensor([2.0, 0.0])
e2 = t.tensor([1.0, 3.0])
u = 2
v = 1

target = u * e1 + v * e2
print(target)

basis = t.stack([e1, e2], dim=1)
weights = t.linalg.solve(basis, target)
print(weights)
# Hidden checks
assert target.tolist() == [5.0, 3.0]
assert t.allclose(weights, t.tensor([2.0, 1.0]))
assert _delta_output == 'tensor([5., 3.])\ntensor([2., 1.])\n'
```
