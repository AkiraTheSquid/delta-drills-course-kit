## Concept

An $m$-by-$n$ matrix has $m$ rows and $n$ columns. Multiplying it by an $n$-component column vector gives $m$ components. Each output component is a row's weighted sum; equivalently, $M\mathbf x$ combines the columns of $M$ using the entries of $\mathbf x$ as weights:
$$\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\c&d\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}ax+by\\cx+dy\end{pmatrix}=x\begin{pmatrix}a\\c\end{pmatrix}+y\begin{pmatrix}b\\d\end{pmatrix}.$$
It is not the same as multiplying matching entries.

In $M\mathbf x=\mathbf b$, $\mathbf x$ holds unknown coefficients, $M$ holds their coefficients in each equation, and $\mathbf b$ holds the right-hand sides. Rows correspond to equations; columns correspond to unknowns. Keep the order of unknowns fixed. Moving a term across equality changes its sign.

Solving means finding coefficients that satisfy every equation simultaneously. Substitute a candidate back: the residual $M\mathbf x-\mathbf b$ must be zero for an exact solution. This checks the equations, not additional inequalities.

Use elimination or substitution on paper: add a multiple of one equation to another to cancel an unknown, then back-substitute. A square system need not have a unique solution; the next lesson gives a test for when it does.

## Worked example

Solve
$$\begin{aligned}2u+v&=5\\u-v&=1\end{aligned}$$

**On paper.** Add the equations to cancel $v$: $3u=6$, so $u=2$. Back-substitute into the second: $2-v=1$, so $v=1$.

In matrix form, with unknown order $(u,v)$:
$$\begin{pmatrix}2&1\\1&-1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}u\\v\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}5\\1\end{pmatrix}.$$
Check by multiplying row by row:
$$\begin{pmatrix}2&1\\1&-1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}2\\1\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}2\cdot2+1\cdot1\\1\cdot2-1\cdot1\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}5\\1\end{pmatrix},$$
so the residual is $(0,0)$.

For a 3D triangular system, solve the last row first and work upward:
$$\begin{aligned}u+2v&=7\\v+w&=5\\w&=2\end{aligned}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad w=2,\;v=3,\;u=1.$$
The principle is unchanged; there is one more coordinate equation.

**In code.** `t.linalg.solve` does the elimination; `@` is the matrix–vector product, so the residual is one line.

```python
import torch as t

matrix = t.tensor([[2.0, 1.0],
                   [1.0, -1.0]])
rhs = t.tensor([5.0, 1.0])

solution = t.linalg.solve(matrix, rhs)
residual = matrix @ solution - rhs

print(solution)
print(residual)
# Hidden checks
assert t.allclose(solution, t.tensor([2.0, 1.0]))
assert t.allclose(residual, t.zeros(2))
assert _delta_output == 'tensor([2., 1.])\ntensor([0., 0.])\n'
```
