# mathematics

## Purpose
- The math lane: lessons with markdown + LaTeX and optional checked Python
  demonstrations, followed by paper reasoning answered as a multiple-choice pick.
  Spec: `docs/spec-math-mc-backbone.md`. Software landed 2026-09-21; **no
  content originally**; the 0.1 content set below now uses this lane.
- Why a lane and not a track: `math.*` concepts sit in the SAME KC graph as
  the coding ones, so a coding KC (`raytracing.ray-parametrisation`) can list
  a math prerequisite and the same picker, ladder and mastery serve both.

## Owns
- `kp-<slug>.md` pages with `kind: math` in the frontmatter (topic
  `Mathematics` in `../kc_registry.json`).
- `kp-<slug>.problems.json` beside each page: the problems that page owns
  (`{"kc": ..., "problems": [...]}` — format in `../math_bank.py`'s
  docstring; ids `>= 50000`).
- 🔑 NOT the MC format itself. Format belongs to the problem, ownership to
  the concept: an MC problem whose prompt assumes torch (`t.linalg.norm`,
  a `(2, 3)` ray tensor, `t.where`) lives in a problems file beside the CODE
  page of the torch/raytracing KC that teaches what it assumes, keeping its
  math atom as a second atom tag (since 2026-09-25; `validate_math.py`).

## Does NOT own
- The loader (`../math_bank.py`, stdlib-only, shared by the exporter, the
  backend and the validator), the gate (`scripts/validate_math.py`), the
  frontend (`practice/math-drill.js`, `styles/practice/math-drill.css`).
- Atom tags (`backend/app/data/question_atom_tags.jsonl`), the atom graph,
  placement clocks (`../placement_time_caps.json`), the glossary `kcLesson`
  map (`../glossary.js`) — each math KC still needs its row in every one of
  those, exactly like a torch KC.

## Key Files
- `kp-<slug>.md`: the page. Same sections as a code KP (`## Concept`,
  `## Worked example`, `## Solo practice`, `## Integrated practice`); prose
  and `$…$` / `$$…$$` LaTeX; runnable demonstrations carry hidden checks.
- `kp-<slug>.problems.json`: the problems. `compute` / `derivation-step`
  carry `verify.sympy` (`truth` + per-choice `value`); `statement` must not.

## Data & External Dependencies
- SymPy 1.14 in `This-Directory-Only/backend/.venv` runs the verification
  (validator only; the backend image never imports it).
- KaTeX (vendored, `vendor/katex`) renders the page, the prompt, the choices
  and the solution in the browser.

## How It Works (Flow)
1. Author page + problems here; add the KC/lesson to the registry, atom tag
   rows, a placement clock, the glossary `kcLesson` line.
2. `pipeline/export_questions_json.py` → the problems join `questions.json`
   as `submission_mode: "mc"` rows; `scripts/compile_lessons.py` →
   `lessons_structured.json` (`kind: "math"`); `scripts/build_qmatrix.py`;
   `scripts/validate_lessons.py --coverage` (runs `validate_math.py`);
   `export_kc_atom_crosswalk.py`; `audit_question_bank.py --gate`;
   `generate_colab_notebooks.py` + `compile_web_notebooks.py`.
3. Backend `app/math_questions.py` loads the same rows at boot; `/submit`
   grades by key compare (`grading.grade_choice`).
4. Frontend: `DeltaMath.mount(q)` swaps the editor for a radio list.

## Invariants & Constraints
- Every `compute` / `derivation-step` problem is PROVEN: `truth` equals the
  keyed choice's `value` and differs from every distractor's, or the gate
  fails with the id named. Never skip the gate to land content.
- Ids are explicit and `>= 50000`, unique across every problems file
  (`math_bank.load_math_rows` raises on a duplicate, so the exporter and
  the backend cannot disagree); the validator, the exporter and the backend
  all refuse a collision with the CSV bank. One rung per problem; `guided`
  stays empty.
- Choices are served in authored order (keys are the author's letters); the
  keyed letter never leaves the server until `/submit`.
- A page with 2+ segments needs one carrier per segment under
  `## Faded practice` (segment gate), though the faded RUNG is retired.
- The prompt renders through the drill renderer (plain text + `code` +
  LaTeX; NO markdown emphasis); the solution renders as full markdown.

## Extension Points
- New concept: copy the shape of an existing page here (e.g.
  `kp-intersection-systems.md` + its problems file), then follow the
  checklist in `../AUTHORING.md` ("Math pages").
- Typed answers / Lean: reserved (`verify.lean` warns, never read); a later
  pass.

## Known Issues, Recurring Bugs, and Pain Points (and How to Prevent Them)

- **Notebook shows no check cell for a math problem** — `RESOLVED`
  - When it happens: `compile_web_notebooks.py` on a lesson with mc rows.
  - Symptom: `notebooks/watch.py` "advertises problem N but has no
    dd-qN-check cell".
  - Root cause: the `dd-q<n>` id grammar promises an editor + checker.
  - Prevention/fix: `colab_cells.mc_problem_cell` emits math problems as
    prose (`dd-mc<n>`, choices listed, no key); the practice page grades.

## Recent Changes
- 2026-09-25: **MC format decoupled from the Mathematics topic.** A code KP
  may carry `kp-<slug>.problems.json` (MC ids only on independent /
  integrated; `validate_lessons.check_kp` exempts them from the code-only
  leak checks and refuses MC ids with no problems file beside the page).
  Eight torch-flavoured problems left these pages for the KC that teaches
  what they assume: 50068 → `raytracing.ray-parametrisation`, 50085 →
  `tensor.row-normalization`, 50091 → `torch.linalg-basics`, 50095 →
  `raytracing.segment-intersection`, 50111 → `raytracing.batched-segments`,
  50098/50102 → `raytracing.mesh-visibility`; 50110 (ray–segment system) →
  `math.intersection-systems`. Ids, keys, SymPy proofs unchanged; each keeps
  its `la-*` / `ray-distance-depth` atom plus the owner's atom. The pages'
  optional torch demonstrations stay (the user asked for code cells,
  2026-09-21); their PROSE no longer uses course terms taught later.
- 2026-09-22: Added `ma-00`, **standalone linear algebra for ARENA 0.1**,
  before the existing application lesson `ma-01`. Five new math KCs,
  30 MCQs (50032–50061), five checked demonstration cells. No new app
  software. The foundations have no coding prerequisites; coding content
  remains available as a separate implementation pathway.

  | Standalone foundation | Transfer into existing 0.1 prep |
  | --- | --- |
  | `math.vector-arithmetic` — components, displacement, scaling | `math.ray-geometry` → rays and finite segments |
  | `math.dot-products-norms` — dot products, length, normalization | `math.ray-distance` → parameter versus Euclidean distance |
  | `math.linear-combinations` — span, independence, basis coordinates | `math.barycentric-coordinates` → triangle edge coordinates |
  | `math.matrix-equations` — row/column interpretation, elimination, residuals | `math.intersection-systems` → ray–segment and ray–triangle equations |
  | `math.determinants-invertibility` — 2D/3D determinants, unique/no/infinite solutions | `math.singular-systems` → valid solves and singular-pair handling |

  Study vector arithmetic first, then linear combinations → matrix
  equations → determinants. Dot products/norms branch from vector
  arithmetic and feed the distance lesson. Each foundation has a distinct
  `la-*` mastery atom, six tagged MCQs, registry prerequisites and explicit
  atom-graph transfer edges. No automatic encompassing/mastery propagation
  is claimed from an application answer back to its foundations.
  Ten of 82 KCs (12.2%) are now mathematics, with 62 math MCQs total.
  Information theory, eigenvalues/SVD, cross products and rotations remain
  outside this focused core-0.1 prerequisite pass.
- 2026-09-22: Landed the 0.1 set: registry rows re-indented to the file's
  own `indent=1` (one-line rows broke `content-mcp`'s byte-identical
  load→save check), full pipeline run (export 1505 rows, compile, qmatrix,
  validate, crosswalk, audit gate, notebooks — `ma-01` notebook has 22 prose
  `dd-mc` cells; the integrated rung is omitted from notebooks like every
  other lesson).
- 2026-09-21: Five math KCs for core ARENA 0.1, 32 MCQs (50000–50031),
  12 independently checked demonstration cells. Topic order: ray geometry →
  intersection systems → singular systems → barycentric coordinates → ray
  distance. Coding KCs depend on these math KCs; existing ARENA exercise
  variants remain the implementation practice. Five of 77 KCs (6.5%) are math.
  Information theory, eigen/SVD material, and optional video/lighting math
  are deferred because they are not prerequisites of the core 0.1 exercises.
  Source: the user's `arena-book/chapter0_fundamentals/exercises/part1_ray_tracing`
  notebook and solutions, with part0_prereqs as supporting context. Origins
  may be nonzero; endpoints count; singular misses are a course convention;
  parameter, x-depth, and Euclidean distance are distinguished explicitly.
  The user requested code cells, so validation now applies the existing
  lesson checked-cell harness to optional math demonstrations. MCQ grading
  remains unchanged. No critic/model reviewer was run (user override).
- 2026-09-21: Folder created with the math MC backbone (software only, no
  pages). Lane contract documented; content is Fable's.
