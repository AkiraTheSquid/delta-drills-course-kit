## Concept: A position plus a displacement

This lesson builds on vector arithmetic: components, displacement, and scalar multiplication. Here those skills describe rays.

A point names a location; a vector names a change in location. Subtracting two points gives a displacement: from $A$ to $B$, move by $B-A$. Adding a displacement to a point gives another point.

A ray is every point
$$P(s)=O+sD,\qquad s\ge0,$$
where $O$ is its origin and $D$ a nonzero direction. $D$ is a displacement, not an endpoint: given an endpoint $Q$, first compute $D=Q-O$. At $s=0$ you are at $O$; negative $s$ lies behind the ray.

A segment from $A$ to $B$ is
$$P(v)=(1-v)A+vB=A+v(B-A),\qquad 0\le v\le1.$$
The weights $1-v$ and $v$ add to one. The supporting line allows any real $v$; the segment does not.

A camera with $n\ge2$ pixels and y-limit $L$ at $x=1$ has equally spaced direction-y values
$$y_i=-L+i\cdot\frac{2L}{n-1},\qquad i=0,\dots,n-1.$$
There are $n-1$ gaps between $n$ endpoints. ARENA uses $D_x=1$, so $s=x$ when $O=0$.

The ray point $O+2D$ for $O=(2,-1)$, $D=(3,2)$. In code, the arithmetic acts on every component at once:

```python
import torch as t

origin = t.tensor([2.0, -1.0])
direction = t.tensor([3.0, 2.0])
s = 2

point = origin + s * direction
print(point)
# Hidden checks
assert point.tolist() == [8.0, 3.0]
assert _delta_output == 'tensor([8., 3.])\n'
```

## Worked example

Find the midpoint of the segment from $A=(-2,3)$ to $B=(6,7)$, and the point that a ray from $O=(2,-1)$ with direction $D=(3,2)$ reaches at $s=2$.

**On paper.** The midpoint is $v=\tfrac12$. Subtract, halve, add:
$$A+\tfrac12(B-A)=\begin{pmatrix}-2\\3\end{pmatrix}+\tfrac12\begin{pmatrix}6-(-2)\\7-3\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}-2\\3\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}4\\2\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}2\\5\end{pmatrix}.$$
Check with the weighted form: $\tfrac12A+\tfrac12B=\tfrac12(4,10)=(2,5)$.

For the ray, scale the direction and add it to the origin:
$$O+2D=\begin{pmatrix}2\\-1\end{pmatrix}+2\begin{pmatrix}3\\2\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}2+6\\-1+4\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}8\\3\end{pmatrix}.$$

**In code.** The midpoint, as one expression.

```python
import torch as t

a = t.tensor([-2.0, 3.0])
b = t.tensor([6.0, 7.0])
v = 0.5

point = a + v * (b - a)
print(point)
# Hidden checks
assert point.tolist() == [2.0, 5.0]
assert _delta_output == 'tensor([2., 5.])\n'
```

## Faded practice

### q50072
A ray starts at O = (1, 2, −1) and passes through Q = (4, 0, 5). Write it as P(s) = O + sD with D = Q − O. Which point is P(2)?

### q50073
A = (2, −1), B = (8, 5). Which point is P(1/3) on the segment P(v) = A + v(B − A)?

### q50074
A ray is P(s) = O + sD with O = (0, 0) and D = (2, −1). For which value of s is P(s) = (6, −3)?

P(s) = (1, 1) + s(2, −1), s ≥ 0. Is (−3, 3) on this ray?

### q50076
A four-pixel camera includes both y-limits −3 and 3 at x = 1, equally spaced. What is the direction-y coordinate of pixel i = 2 (counting from i = 0)?

### q50077
A = (0, 4, 2), B = (6, −2, 8). Which v puts A + v(B − A) at (4, 0, 6)?

## Integrated practice

### q50004
A five-pixel camera includes both y-limits −3 and 3 at x = 1. Which sequence contains the direction-y coordinates?

### q50005
A point has v = 0.2 from A to B. Swap the endpoints and write P = B + w(A − B). What is w?

### q50078
Five rays start at (0, 0, 0). Ray i has direction (1, y_i, 0), where y_0, …, y_4 are evenly spaced from −2 to 2. Where does ray i = 3 reach x = 4?

### q50079
A camera stores ray i's direction as [1, y_i, 0]. A second version stores [2, 2y_i, 0] instead, same origins. What changes about where each ray hits a wall?
