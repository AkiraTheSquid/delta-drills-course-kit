## Concept

A vector is an ordered list of components, written as a column:
$$\mathbf v=\begin{pmatrix}v_x\\v_y\\v_z\end{pmatrix}.$$
Add and subtract matching components; multiply every component by a scalar:
$$\begin{pmatrix}1\\2\\3\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}4\\-1\\0\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}5\\1\\3\end{pmatrix},\qquad -2\begin{pmatrix}1\\2\\3\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}-2\\-4\\-6\end{pmatrix}.$$
A negative scale reverses direction; zero gives the zero vector.

A point is a location in a chosen coordinate frame. The displacement from point $A$ to point $B$ is $B-A$, not $A+B$. Adding a displacement to a point gives a point. Check the order with
$$A+(B-A)=B.$$

Translation changes point coordinates but not a displacement:
$$(B+T)-(A+T)=B-A.$$
Direction vectors are not endpoints. Their components describe how a point changes when a parameter increases by one.

## Worked example

Find the displacement from $A=(2,-1,3)$ to $B=(5,3,1)$, then the midpoint of $AB$.

**On paper.** Write both points as columns and subtract component by component:
$$B-A=\begin{pmatrix}5\\3\\1\end{pmatrix}-\begin{pmatrix}2\\-1\\3\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}5-2\\3-(-1)\\1-3\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}3\\4\\-2\end{pmatrix}.$$
The midpoint is $A$ plus half that displacement:
$$A+\tfrac12(B-A)=\begin{pmatrix}2\\-1\\3\end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix}1.5\\2\\-1\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}3.5\\1\\2\end{pmatrix}.$$
Reversing the subtraction gives $A-B=(-3,-4,2)$, the displacement back.

**In code.** The same two steps. Each operation acts on every component at once, so no loop is needed. Predict the printed values before running it.

```python
import torch as t

a = t.tensor([2.0, -1.0, 3.0])
b = t.tensor([5.0, 3.0, 1.0])

displacement = b - a
midpoint = a + 0.5 * displacement

print(displacement)
print(midpoint)
# Hidden checks
assert displacement.tolist() == [3.0, 4.0, -2.0]
assert midpoint.tolist() == [3.5, 1.0, 2.0]
assert _delta_output == 'tensor([ 3.,  4., -2.])\ntensor([3.5000, 1.0000, 2.0000])\n'
```
