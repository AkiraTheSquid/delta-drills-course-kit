## Concept

The third einops function, **`einops.repeat`, is the mirror image of
reduce: the output may contain names (or factors) the input DOESN'T have**
— and the data is copied to fill them. Two distinct moves live under it:

**1. A brand-new axis** — a name on the right that's absent on the left:

> `repeat(cls, 'b d -> b t d', t=8)`
> — each (b, d) embedding is broadcast across 8 new time steps. This is
> einops' answer to `broadcast_to` / `unsqueeze` + `expand`: the classic use is
> spreading a class token or per-token weights across a new dimension.

**2. Stretching an existing axis** — a factor inside output parens that
wasn't in the input:

> `repeat(img, 'c h w -> c (h 3) w')` — each ROW appears 3× consecutively
> (h slow, 3 fast: row, its copies, next row). Nearest-neighbor upscaling
> is this on both axes: `'h w c -> (h 2) (w 2) c'`.
> `repeat(img, 'c h w -> c (3 h) w')` — the WHOLE image stacked 3 times
> (3 slow: full copy, then full copy). PyTorch's
> `repeat_interleave`-vs-`repeat` distinction, decided by paren ORDER
> instead of function choice.

The order rule is the one you already own from merging: **left = slow =
blocks, right = fast = within-block.** `(h k)` interleaves copies per row;
`(k h)` concatenates whole copies. Literal numbers can sit in the parens
directly, or be keywords (`(h k), k=3`).

New-axis literals work too: `'h w -> h w 3'` copies a grayscale image into
3 identical channels.

## Worked example

Task: broadcast an embedding across time; stretch rows; whole-image stack —
the three moves, distinguished.

```python
import torch as t
import einops

# 1. NEW AXIS: (b, d) -> (b, t, d), each embedding
# copied t times.
cls = t.tensor([[1.0, 2.0],
                # (b=2, d=2)
                [3.0, 4.0]])
seq = einops.repeat(cls, 'b d -> b t d', t=3)

print("new axis:", tuple(cls.shape), "->",
      tuple(seq.shape), "| item 0 =", seq[0].tolist())
# Hidden checks
assert seq.shape == (2, 3, 2)
assert seq[0].tolist() == [[1.0, 2.0]] * 3   # identical copies down t
```

That was a brand-new axis. The second move stretches an axis that already exists; which side of the name the factor sits on decides the layout.

```python
import torch as t
import einops

# 2. STRETCH, factor fast: each ROW repeats
# consecutively.
img = t.tensor([[1, 2],
                # (h, w) for clarity
                [3, 4]])
rows3 = einops.repeat(img, 'h w -> (h r) w', r=2)

print("'(h r)' factor FAST — each row repeats:\n",
      rows3)
# Hidden checks
assert rows3.tolist() == [[1, 2],
                          [1, 2],
                          [3, 4],
                          [3, 4]]            # row, its copy, next row
```

Same data, same factor, other side of the name: now the copy index is the SLOW one, so the whole block repeats.

```python
import torch as t
import einops

# 3. STRETCH, factor slow: the WHOLE block repeats.
whole = einops.repeat(img, 'h w -> (r h) w', r=2)

print("'(r h)' factor SLOW — the block repeats:\n",
      whole)
# Hidden checks
assert whole.tolist() == [[1, 2],
                          [3, 4],
                          [1, 2],
                          [3, 4]]            # full image, then again
```

Put the fast factor on both spatial axes at once and every pixel becomes a block — nearest-neighbour upscaling.

```python
import torch as t
import einops

# Nearest-neighbor 2x upscale: both axes, factor fast
# on each.
up = einops.repeat(img, 'h w -> (h a) (w b)', a=2,
                   b=2)
print("2x nearest-neighbor upscale:\n", up)
# Hidden checks
assert up.tolist() == [[1, 1, 2, 2],
                       [1, 1, 2, 2],
                       [3, 3, 4, 4],
                       [3, 3, 4, 4]]
```

Why each step:

1. `(h r)` vs `(r h)` on the same data is the `repeat_interleave`-vs-`repeat` shootout
   resettled by one convention (left slow) instead of two function names —
   run both once, then trust the rule.
2. `repeat` promises the VALUES and the shape, not fresh memory: on the
   torch backend the result is usually an `expand` view (check
   `seq.is_contiguous()`). Call `.contiguous()` or `.clone()` before writing
   into it.
3. The upscale's per-axis factors (a, b) show the moves composing — each
   axis independently gets the "pixel becomes a block" treatment, and the
   2×2 blocks in the output are the proof.

## Faded practice

### q317
Triple an image's height by repeating each row consecutively.

```python starter
import torch as t
import einops

def solve(img):
    """(c, h, w) -> (c, 3h, w): each row appears 3x in a row."""
    return einops._____(img, 'c h w -> c (_____) w')
```

```python solution
import torch as t
import einops

def solve(img):
    """(c, h, w) -> (c, 3h, w): each row appears 3x in a row."""
    return einops.repeat(img, 'c h w -> c (h 3) w')
```

## Guided practice

### q351
1. Double both spatial dims with each pixel becoming a 2×2 block —
   stretch, and which order makes copies stay WITH their pixel?
2. Factor fast: `(h 2) (w 2)`.
3. `'h w c -> (h 2) (w 2) c'` — check one corner block.

## Independent practice

From the drill bank: q338 (broadcast class embeddings across time), q348
(rows repeated 3× consecutively, batched),
q385 (columns repeated 4× IN SEQUENCE — which order?), q341 (whole image
stacked k times vertically — the other order), q339 (per-token scalar
weights (b, t) expanded to (b, t, d)), q383 (duplicate the whole channel
BLOCK r times — slow or fast?).

Also from the bank: q352 (stretch vertically by duplicating each ROW in
place — '(h k)', new index FASTEST), q355 (slice, stack two images
vertically, then repeat the strip horizontally), q893 (a second copy to the
right), q894 (n whole copies stacked), q896 (grayscale to three channels),
q901 (every column doubled in place), q902 (every row k times in place).

## Integrated practice

q933–q940 combine `reduce` (per-week statistics) with `repeat` (laying the
statistic back over the days). Three of them need a standard deviation:
`einops.reduce` accepts a FUNCTION as its aggregation (`t.std`, which divides
by n−1) — see the reduce KP's concept section.

### q895
2x2 tiling

### q897
side by side, doubled vertically

### q898
vertical stack, n copies wide

### q899
each image doubled in place

### q900
grayscale stack + double

### q903
2x nearest-neighbour upscale

### q904
anisotropic stretch

### q933
difference from weekly max

### q934
difference from block mean, k days

### q935
ratio to weekly mean

### q936
2-D weekly differences

### q937
min-max normalisation per week

### q938
z-score within k-day blocks

### q939
scale by weekly std

### q940
2-D weekly z-scores

## Misconceptions

- **"repeat is rearrange with bigger numbers."** — rearrange is a
  bijection (every input element appears once); repeat COPIES. The
  found-on-the-right-only names/factors are what license the copying.
- **"'(h 2)' and '(2 h)' both just double the axis."** — Same length,
  different layout: h-slow keeps copies adjacent to their source row
  (stretch); 2-slow lays whole blocks end to end (tile). Tasks say
  "consecutively"/"each row" vs "whole image again" — map the words to
  the order.
- **"Broadcasting makes repeat unnecessary."** — Broadcasting stretches
  virtually inside ONE operation; repeat returns a tensor that HAS the new
  shape, which is what a drill's return-shape contract (and much downstream
  code) requires. It may still be a view — do not assume fresh memory.
