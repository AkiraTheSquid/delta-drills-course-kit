"""watch.py — health checks for the einops-lesson KP sources

These 11 markdown files are the taught side of eo-1..eo-3; the drills they
fade into live in the question bank. The defect worth catching cheaply is
DIALECT DRIFT between the two halves.

The bank is being converted from NumPy to the PyTorch dialect ARENA uses, one
lesson at a time. While that is in progress a KP file and the questions it
embeds can disagree — the page builds fixtures with `np.arange` while the
drill grades a tensor. Nothing else notices: the exercise still passes its own
tests, and the learner just gets whiplash.

So: every KP is required to be internally consistent, and to match the dialect
of the bank questions it fades into. Files are parsed, never executed —
scripts/validate_lessons.py already runs the fences (with torch, so it needs
the backend venv) and it is the slow, thorough gate. This is the fast
structural one.

Runs via `mod watch` — exit 0 = PASS, exit non-zero = FAIL.
