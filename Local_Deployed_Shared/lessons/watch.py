"""watch.py — health checks for lessons

This folder is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for what the tutor may teach: the ITS serves
only questions carrying a `target_kcs` entry in qmatrix_tags.json (see
docs/decision-kc-only-serving.md). That makes a silent corruption here
equivalent to silently un-teaching part of the curriculum, so these checks
guard the structure rather than the prose.

Runs via `mod watch` — exit 0 = PASS, exit non-zero = FAIL.

# Chapter 1 is authored and frozen as the validation reference set. A drop here
# means KCs were lost, not that new ones were added — growth is expected.
# Lowered from 64 to 63 on 2026-07-28: numpy.structured-dtypes was RETIRED, not
# lost. Record dtypes, datetime64 and genfromtxt have no PyTorch form — a tensor
# is homogeneous — so the KC could not follow the course into torch.
# 63 -> 37 on 2026-08-30, the cut back to the ARENA-necessary path. 35 KCs were
# retired in one pass: the whole einsum course (ARENA writes einops.einsum in 61
# of its 458 notebooks and torch.einsum in NONE), all of np-4, and the np-2/np-3
# concepts whose own operations appear in fewer than ~5% of the corpus. What is
# left is the closure of the einops nodes plus the high-frequency tensor
# literacy under them, which is why the floor equals the count exactly: this
# graph is meant to stop shrinking. The retired pages are in
# This-Directory-Only/archive/retired-content-2026-08-30/ and their drills in
# Local_Deployed_Shared/pipeline/retired_question_ids.json.

# in the same pass dropped this to 343, which was 30 questions of unexplained
# slack -- a floor that loose would let a quarter of a lesson fall out of the
# ITS without failing. 370 keeps the small headroom a floor needs and nothing
# more.
# 370 -> 290 on 2026-08-30 with the same cut: 218 drills went with their
# concepts, leaving 293 tagged. Three questions of headroom, for the same
# reason as above -- the floor is here to catch a lesson falling out silently,
