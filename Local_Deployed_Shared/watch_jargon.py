"""watch_jargon.py — the jargon-link layer's checks.

Same contract as every check in watch.py: raise AssertionError to fail. Kept
in its own file the way watch_instructor_graph.py and watch_front_door.py are
(watch.py is already past Modulario's 700-LOC line). watch.py should import
`check_jargon_links` into its namespace and keep it in the __main__ list — a
runner list has dropped checks SILENTLY twice in this repo, so the import and
the list entry are both load-bearing.

What this guards, 2026-08-27: jargon.js underlines ~73 course terms in lesson
prose, and each one opens a panel whose button sends the learner to the
concept that teaches it, maximized, in a new tab. Every way that breaks is
quiet:

  - a glossary entry pointing at a KC id that does not exist focuses NOTHING;
    deltaFocusConceptGraphKc returns on an unknown id by design, so the new
    tab opens on the graph and simply sits there;
  - decorating inside <code> would underline Python identifiers, which reads
    as "you can click your own program";
  - a term linked inside the lesson that teaches it is a link to the page you
    are already reading;
  - the kcLesson map in glossary.js is a COPY of the registry, so it can drift
    without anything failing;
  - the three tags in index.html are what load the feature at all, and two of
    three loads a stylesheet with no behaviour, or an engine with no glossary.
