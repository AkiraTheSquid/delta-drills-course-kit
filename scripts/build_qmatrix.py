"""Build Local_Deployed_Shared/lessons/qmatrix_tags.json.

Tag sources, in priority order:
  1. KP frontmatter — a question referenced as faded/guided/independent/
     integrated by a KP gets that KP's KC as target, the KP's supporting list,
     and its new_syntax.
  2. LEFTOVER_TARGETS below — hand-assigned targets for easy-topic questions no
     KP references (reviewed against each question's text; see
     docs/spec-first-encounter-course-content.md).

Run after editing KP refs; validate with scripts/validate_lessons.py --coverage.
