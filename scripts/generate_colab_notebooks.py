"""generate_colab_notebooks.py — compile the authored lessons into Colab notebooks.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The tutor is moving its student-facing surface from the web app to Google Colab.
The engine does not move: prerequisite gating, BKT + FIRe, decay-driven
resurfacing and the expertise-reversal ladder all stay in the backend, and the
Chrome side panel becomes a second client of the same endpoints. What has to
move is the *content* — the 63 authored knowledge points and the 424 problems
attached to them have to exist as cells in a notebook the panel can navigate to.

INPUTS (read-only — this script never writes into `lessons/`)
    Local_Deployed_Shared/lessons/lessons_structured.json   compiled lessons
    Local_Deployed_Shared/questions_structured.json         the 499-question bank

OUTPUT
    One notebook per lesson, nbformat 4.5, into --out.
    A notebook index, into --index, that the side panel loads as a plain script.

WHY THE INDEX EXISTS
--------------------
The tutor selects weakest-first across ALL subtopics and each lesson is its own
subtopic, so two consecutive problems routinely live in two different notebooks.
`/next-question` names a subtopic and a KC but not a file, so something has to
map `question_id -> lesson -> notebook`. That map is a property of how these
notebooks were compiled, which means it belongs here, next to the compiler, and
not hand-maintained in the extension.

WHAT IS NOT HERE
----------------
What a CELL is — id minting, the four-cell shape of a problem, the checker —
lives in `colab_cells.py`, together with the two invariants that bite (stable
ids, and which fences become runnable cells). This file is the compiler: it
decides which cells a lesson turns into, in what order, and writes them out.

            # problem, in the right order. But `colab_focus.js` decides what is
            # in focus by the NUMBER in `dd-q<n>`, and these were anchored to
            # the segment (`<kc>-<title>-worked`), which carries no number. So
            # the moment the panel routed a learner to the problem, focus hid
            # the example sitting immediately above it — for all 118 segments,
            # silently, leaving a bare problem that looks exactly like a
            # problem. "It's on the worked example one, and yet it doesn't have
            # a worked example."
            #
            # Anchoring them `dd-q<problem>-worked` puts them in that problem's
            # group, so scrolling up from the problem lands on the example that
            # was always meant to be there. It costs no content and no authoring
            # — the example is already written for every segment.
            #
            # ONE COPY PER PROBLEM, not one per segment. A cell has a single id
            # and a single id names a single group, so a segment with two faded
            # items cannot have both of them share one example — three segments
            # do author two (np-3 `numpy.rescaling`, es-1 `einsum.matvec-matmul`,
            # eo-1 `einops.merge-axes`), and anchoring to the first left the
            # second as the exact bare problem this change exists to abolish.

            # it checks anchors rather than lesson records.

            # Duplicating the cells is right rather than merely expedient: the
            # two problems are never in focus together, so no learner ever meets
            # the repeat. Reading the notebook unfocused gives

    """The `question_id -> notebook` map, as a plain dict.

    Two consumers serialize this differently, which is why the dict is built
    once here and written twice by `main`:

    * the Chrome side panel loads it with a `<script>` tag (`--index`), because
      MV3's CSP forbids remote script but a bundled file is fine, and a script
      tag avoids putting a second HTTP client next to `api.js`;
    * the web app fetches it as JSON (`--web-index`), because it has no bundler
      and every other data file it reads arrives the same way.

    Both must come from this function. The web app opens the Colab notebook the
    learner is expected to run the problem in, so a map that disagrees with the
    notebooks on disk sends them to the wrong cell.

    Three lookup keys, because `/next-question` does not always give the same
    one. `questions` is exact and covers every authored problem;
    `subtopics` catches a question the bank added after this ran; `kcs` is what
    the lesson gate resolves through, since a gate names a KC and not a
    question.
