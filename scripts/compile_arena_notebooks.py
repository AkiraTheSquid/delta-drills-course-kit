"""compile_arena_notebooks.py — the ARENA exercise notebooks, shaped for the app.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The Courses tab is the ARENA curriculum: five chapters, thirty-two sections,
every section a notebook Callum McDougall publishes. Until now clicking one
LEFT the app — the section rows were `<a target="_blank">` at Google Colab, and
the fork gate existed to point them at the student's own ARENA_3.0 fork.

Seth, 2026-09-01: "it won't actually take you to the Google Colab. It will
instead stay inside of the app, and it will have an app version of those arena
notebooks." So the section rows open `practice/arena-notebook.js`, and this is
what feeds it: the upstream `.ipynb` rewritten into the same cell JSON the
lesson notebooks already use, so the ARENA notebook is rendered by the same CSS
and reads like the notebook surface next door.

🔴 THIS IS NOT `compile_web_notebooks.py`, AND THE DIFFERENCE MATTERS.
That compiler emits DELTA DRILLS content: it calls `build_notebook`, the one
function that also mints the .ipynb, so the two editions cannot drift. There is
no such shared function here, because the source is not ours — it is upstream's
notebook, read as data. Nothing in this file may edit what a cell SAYS. It
decides only which cells exist, what kind each one is, and how HTML that the
app's markdown renderer would escape is turned back into markdown.

WHERE THE SECTION LIST COMES FROM
    `Local_Deployed_Shared/courses.js`. That file is the curriculum — chapter
    titles, section numbers, section descriptions, and the book URL each row
    points at — and it is what the learner reads. Parsing it here keeps ONE
    list: a section added to the Courses tab gets a notebook on the next
    compile, and a section that is not on the tab cannot be opened. The parse
    is strict (see `_sections`): a courses.js that stops matching fails the
    run rather than quietly compiling half a curriculum.

INPUTS (read-only)
    Local_Deployed_Shared/courses.js                      the section list
    Local_Deployed_Shared/content/ARENA_3.0-fork/**.ipynb Seth's fork — FIRST
    Local_Deployed_Shared/content/ARENA_5.0-main/**.ipynb upstream — fallback

    THE FORK WINS. Seth, 2026-09-06: "make it such that it still mirrors the
    github along with the colab ... I'm working through this content with a
    group, and they are pulling the directory on their end." So a section
    whose notebook exists in `github.com/AkiraTheSquid/ARENA_3.0` is compiled
    from THAT file — the same file the Colab link opens and the group pulls —
    and only a section the fork does not carry falls back to the upstream 5.0
    cut. `scripts/sync_arena_fork.sh` keeps the checkout current; the deploy
    runs it before this compile. Each section records which edition it came
    from (`edition`, `owner`) so the view can say so.

    🔴 `Local_Deployed_Shared/content/` is gitignored — 89 MB of upstream
    course repos that live on this machine and are not part of this repo. A
    clone without it cannot run this script, which is why the output is
    committed rather than regenerated on demand.

OUTPUT
    Local_Deployed_Shared/lessons/notebooks/arena-<slug>.json   one per section
    Local_Deployed_Shared/lessons/notebooks/arena-index.json    the index
    Local_Deployed_Shared/lessons/notebooks/arena-curriculum.json  exercise/preparation graph

    Written into the lessons/notebooks folder, next to the Delta Drills
    notebooks, because the view fetches them the same way and the deploy
    already mirrors that folder wholesale. `arena-` is the prefix that keeps
    the two sets apart — `compile_web_notebooks.py` deletes any *.json in
    there that its own manifest does not name, so its stale-file sweep skips
    this prefix (there is a check for that in scripts/watch.py).
