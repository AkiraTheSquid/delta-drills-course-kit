"""Every call in a drill's SOLUTION must have a lesson before that drill.

The rule, stated the way it is enforced
---------------------------------------
A drill is served for one concept. Its solution is what the learner has to
produce. So every symbol that solution uses — every function, every method,
every attribute, every language construct — must be declared by the
`new_syntax:` of a KP page whose KC sits **at or before** the drill's own KC in
the prerequisite lattice. A symbol no page declares, or one first declared
after the drill, means the drill asks for something the graph has not taught.

`a.T` is the case that motivated this. It appeared in eight faded drills on
`torch.tensor-model` — the first concept of the course — while the only page
that mentioned transposition sat four lessons later. Nothing failed. A learner
hit it on their second day and had to go ask a different model what the
question meant.

Why it is not `audit_question_syntax.py`
----------------------------------------
That audit asks the same question of three surfaces, and is deliberately
generous about what counts as syntax: its `ASSUMED` set exempts `len`, `for`,
comprehensions, comparison and a dozen more as "the audience already writes
plain Python". That was true before the course had a Python floor. It is not
true now — `py-0` teaches names, types, lists, indexing and functions, so a
drill reaching for a set comprehension is reaching past its own curriculum in
exactly the way `a.T` did. This audit exempts NOTHING: every construct is
looked up, and the ones the old audit would have waved through are still
reported, tagged `assumed`, so the two numbers can be compared.

Baseline
--------
The corpus has a large existing backlog. Shipping this as a hard failure would
paint the build red and teach everyone to ignore it, so the check is a
RATCHET: `scripts/solution_prereq_baseline.json` records today's violations,
`watch.py` fails on anything not in it, and the file is meant to shrink.
`--write-baseline` re-records. Re-recording is a content decision — it is how
new debt gets admitted, so it should show up in a diff and be argued for.

Usage
-----
    python3 scripts/audit_solution_prereqs.py                  # full report
    python3 scripts/audit_solution_prereqs.py --summary        # counts
    python3 scripts/audit_solution_prereqs.py --by-symbol      # worst symbols
    python3 scripts/audit_solution_prereqs.py --qid 535
    python3 scripts/audit_solution_prereqs.py --new            # vs baseline
    python3 scripts/audit_solution_prereqs.py --write-baseline
Exit 1 when anything is reported (or, with --new, when anything is NEW).
