"""compile_web_notebooks.py — the Colab notebooks, shaped for the web app.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
The default (non-Colab) edition renders a lesson as a notebook now, against the
persistent kernel from `app/kernel_runner.py`. That notebook has to be the SAME
notebook the Colab edition publishes — same prose, same runnable fences, same
four-cell problems, same `dd_check` cases — or a learner who reads one and a
learner who reads the other are on two different courses.

The only way to guarantee that is to not compile it twice. This script calls
`generate_colab_notebooks.build_notebook`, the function that already decides
which cells a lesson turns into and in what order, and rewrites its output into
the shape a browser wants. Nothing about content, ordering or ids is decided
here; if a cell is wrong it is wrong in both editions, which is the point.

WHAT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE .ipynb
    - nbformat scaffolding is dropped: no `metadata`, no `execution_count`, no
      empty `outputs` list per cell. Those exist for Jupyter and cost ~30% of
      the bytes over the wire.
    - Each cell gains a `role` and, where it has one, the problem it belongs
      to. The extension derives both from the cell id in JS
      (`content/colab_focus.js` groups by the number in `dd-q<n>`); deriving
      them once here means the web renderer reads a field instead of keeping a
      second copy of the id grammar, and `scripts/watch.py` can check it.

    `setup` and `checker` are the two cells the notebook opens with and neither
    is content: setup names the lesson for the extension and has nothing to run,
    and the checker is an 80 KB base64 payload that must run before any
    `dd_check` and must never be shown as if it were a lesson.

    `solution` is the one role with a rule attached rather than a look: it is
    the answer, and it stays unreadable until the learner asks. `check` is the
    cell whose printed verdict is the only thing that reaches the engine.

    `hints` is called out because its source is a raw `<details>` block. The
    web renderer escapes HTML — deliberately, it renders authored markdown from
    a repo — so a hints cell handed to it as prose would put the literal text
    `<details>` on screen. Naming the role here lets the renderer unwrap it
    into a real disclosure element and render only the markdown inside.
